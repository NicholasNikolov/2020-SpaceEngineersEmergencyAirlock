 Code for Space Engineers that locks doors based on compromised hull.

Space Engineers is a voxel-based building game wherein the player designs a ship, including connections for air and fuel.

Each ship can be pressurized and heated through a series of vents that transport oxygen through the craft. If this hull is depressurized, then the oxygen level and temperature will swiftly drop which, in a survival game mode, would mean swift death if not repaired.

My goal is to design a ship that can respond automatically to hull breaches of this sort by running frequent checks on the pressurization of the hull. The ship was designed as one narrow corridor in the center, with bays on the outer parts. If a single bay is punctured, the bay door should close and begin a warning light that is turned red.

This is sort of a fun project. Nothing too serious here but it is a fun challenge! :)
